# POKEDEX (SERVER SIDE) 

## Why Pokedex?

First we wanted to create a fun app for Pokedex lovers around the world!

They can create their profile with a cool avatar and then sift through 900 pokemons and choose both their team (6 pokemons only) and their favorites (as many as you want!!).
They can even rename their Pokemon if they're feeling creative ;)

Second, we wanted to learn new things and keep on improving our freshly acquired Ironhack skills!
The Filters component was a wonderful challenge for us, as we wanted users to be able to see pokemons filtered by Types. So they could be able to select 2 types at once and still be able to use our search bar

We also were passionate about learning TDD and our goal is to test our entire API with Mocha.


To get our Pokemons, we used Pok√©API!

You can find it[here](https://pokeapi.co/)


## Test our Pokedex!

We ask for your patience, it will be deployed very soon ;)
